# AI-Language-Learning-Assistant

The goal of this project is to create an application that can be used to train writing, speaking, and listening language comprehension skills.
The current goal of this project is to develop a modular system that can support a variety of different approaches to the subtask, such as speech synthesis or language processing. This should allow the simple replacement of, for example, local AI models with API-based ones.
